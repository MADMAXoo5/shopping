      all modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <i>fundamental</i>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web. In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
      about, and why you too should learn it.
    </p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext<b>M</b>arkup<b>L</b>anguage It's a
      markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the
      content of a webpage (not a programming language). HTML consists of
      elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links,
      headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML
      code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
      <ol>
        
        <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>why should you use html</h3>
    <p>

      
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li> hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ
  
    </ul>

    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!
